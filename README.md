## PROJECT OBJECTIVE :

### Building a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets as either related to real disasters or not.

## My approach:

1. Importing the required libraries and reading the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Cleaning by creating utils.py
4. tokenizing the text file and Training model
5. Evaluating the model and saving the most accurate model in folder model using pickle
6. Deploying the model using flask by creating a app.py and index.html
